<h2> Hey there 👋  I'm Kimsure. You can also call me Justin.</h2>

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h3>

- 🌱 &nbsp; I'm working for vivo Mobile Communication Ltd. as a Camera ISP Algorithm Engineer, especially focusing on auto-focus and image/video stabilization.

- 🔭 &nbsp; I got an M.Eng. degree at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU) in MePro, advised by Associate Prof. Meiqin Liu and Chao Yao. My research interest lies in **image/video low-level processing** (e.g. super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, etc) and **content generation**. I am also interested in **semantic segmentation and alignment** with active learning and domain adaptation.

- 😄 &nbsp; I am currently looking for **a Ph.D. opportunity in computer vision or image/video processing**.

- 🤔 &nbsp; I am looking for help with how to host a website locally.
