<h2> Hey there 👋  I'm Kimsure.</h2>

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h3>

- 🌱 &nbsp; I am a final year M.Eng. student at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU) in MePro, advised by Associate Prof. Meiqin Liu and Chao Yao. And I will work for vivo Mobile Communication Ltd. as a Camera ISP Algorithm Engineer.

- 🔭 &nbsp; My research interest lies at image/video low-level processing (e.g. super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, etc). I am also interested in image/video compression.

- 😄 &nbsp; I am currently learning the image processing pipeline using python or cpp and video codec.

- 🤔 &nbsp; I am looking for help with how to host a website locally.
