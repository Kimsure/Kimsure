<h2> Hey there 👋  I'm Sherlock Kim. You can also call me Kimsure.</h2>

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h3>

- 🌱 &nbsp; I'm currently a Ph.D candidate at Liverpool University, advised by Prof. Jimin Xiao and Siyue Yu. Previously, I was a Camera ISP Algorithm Engineer at vivo Mobile Communication Ltd.

- 🔭 &nbsp; I got my M.Eng. degree at Institute of Information Science (Group Leader: Yao Zhao, IEEE Fellow), Beijing Jiaotong University, advised by Associate Prof. Meiqin Liu and Chao Yao. My research interests include **semantic guided image/video low-level processing** and **semantic segmentation** with **content generation** and **domain adaptation**.

- 😄 &nbsp; I am actively looking for co-operators who are interested in **exploiting semantics for low-level task** or **exploring generation models for weakly-supervised high-level task**.

- 🤔 &nbsp; I am looking for help with how to host a website locally.
